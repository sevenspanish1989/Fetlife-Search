# Fetlife-Search

This is an iMacros script to search for Fetlife users by age/role and location</br>
It is one of the first things I've ever written, so be gentle</br>
All suggestions for improvement are welcome</br>


This script will **ONLY** work in the **Firefox** version of iMacros!</br>
It's not blazing fast, but it does automate the process</br>
I have been using it for a while and haven't been banned, but...</br>
**DISCLAIMER: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**</br>
